# ROADMAP.md — Build One Milestone at a Time

Rule for the agent: work on the **current milestone only**. Do not touch packages listed under later milestones, even if it seems convenient. Each milestone ends with its Definition of Done (see TDD.md) fully met before moving to the next.

---

## M0 — Workspace foundation

**Build**: pnpm workspace scaffold, TypeScript config, ESLint, Vitest config, CI pipeline (lint → unit → build), empty `packages/core` and `apps/` folders with correct dependency direction enforced (no upper layer imported by a lower one).
**Do not touch**: any business logic.
**Done when**: CI runs green on an empty scaffold.

## M1 — Core + Indicators + Risk

**Build**: `packages/core` (Decision type, state machine skeleton, interfaces, Zod schemas), `packages/indicators` (RSI/ATR/EMA/SMA/ADX/VWAP, self-implemented), `packages/risk` (sizing strategies, ATR-based stop/TP).
**Do not touch**: LLM, exchanges, Android, notifications, benchmark.
**Done when**: all TDD.md "Indicators" and "Risk engine" tests pass. No exchange or network code exists yet.

## M2 — Validation + Guardrails + Property tests

**Build**: validation layer, full guardrail rule set (as a pure, deterministic module operating on mock inputs), property tests against guardrails.
**Do not touch**: real exchange, real LLM, Android.
**Done when**: every guardrail rule in TDD.md has a passing test, and property tests run 100k+ random cases without a single violation.

## M3 — Exchange abstraction + Paper exchange

**Build**: `packages/exchanges` interface, a `paper` exchange adapter (simulated fills, no real API calls), exchange contract tests using mocked CCXT responses.
**Do not touch**: real Indodax credentials, live trading.
**Done when**: the paper exchange can process a simulated order end-to-end and contract tests pass.

## M4 — Replay engine + Dataset recorder

**Build**: `packages/datasets` (record/version/compress/replay), `apps/backtest` in replay-only mode against the paper exchange and a static historical dataset.
**Do not touch**: any LLM provider yet — use fixed/scripted decisions to prove the replay pipeline works before an LLM is in the loop.
**Done when**: replaying the same dataset twice produces identical output (deterministic).

## M5 — LLM providers

**Build**: `packages/llm` `DecisionEngine` interface, at least two provider adapters (e.g. one free-tier — Gemini or OpenRouter — plus Anthropic), contract tests run against both with the same fixtures, timeout handling.
**Do not touch**: Indodax live keys, Android, benchmark app.
**Done when**: both providers pass the identical `DecisionEngine` contract test suite, and `backtest --record` can capture real LLM decisions into the dataset format from M4.

## M6 — Benchmark

**Build**: `apps/benchmark` — runs recorded contexts (from M4/M5) through multiple provider/model configs, produces the leaderboard (valid-JSON rate, latency, cost, win rate, PnL, drawdown, consistency test).
**Do not touch**: Indodax live integration.
**Done when**: you can run the benchmark across at least 2 free models and 1 paid model on the same recorded dataset and get a comparable leaderboard.

## M7 — Indodax live adapter

**Build**: real `packages/exchanges/indodax` implementation (replacing paper for this adapter), retry policy, clock sync, exchange filters, reconciliation (startup + periodic), authenticated control commands, cost/budget caps, daily reset logic, position ownership policy.
**Do not touch**: Android deployment — build and test this on a dev machine first, paper mode only.
**Done when**: a full paper-mode run against real Indodax market data (real prices, simulated fills) survives a 10,000-candle E2E test with no crashes, no NaN, deterministic PnL.

## M8 — Android / Termux deployment

**Build**: Termux + proot-distro setup scripts, device-health monitoring, wake-lock handling, heartbeat, circuit breakers tied to device state, `tmux`-based persistence.
**Done when**: the M7 paper-mode agent runs unattended on the phone for a defined soak period (e.g. 1-2 weeks) with no missed heartbeats beyond the alerting threshold and no state corruption after at least one forced reboot.

## Only after M8, and only as a separate, explicit decision

Enabling live trading (`mode: live` + `--confirm-live` + `LIVE_CONFIRMATION` env var) is not a milestone — it's a decision made after M8 has run clean in paper mode for an extended period across varied market conditions, on a small allocation.
